Hello people, this chapter is not about coding or anything related to progamming. 

its purely about investment on cryptocurrency and reviewing a blockchain project named starcoin.

There 2 things interesting investment on starcoin blockchain will be reviewed:
- stc-box miner
- kikoverse nft mining

if you have huge budget -> stc-box maybe good for starter

low budget -> nft mining will be you choice for now :)

but this is NOT a FINANCIAL ADVICE

if you are interested, please feel free to try and invest.


If you like to buy starcoin, can you go [gate.io][gateio-site] (I recommend to finish your ekyc first before deposit to avoid any problem on withdrawal later).

if you like to support me, please use the my referral by click the link above.
Thank you very much :)

Disclaimer:

always invest which you can afford to lose, don't ever your your daily funds.
