It is very easy and no need technical knowledge to do participate on this activity.

You just need to install zelcore app wallet and of-course the flux itself.

how to buy / get flux easier using zelcore app exchange or by using centralized exchange such as [gate.io][gateio]

so let's get into it!

## Install Zelcore App
Go to [zelcore.io][wallet-zelcore] and download based on your platform.
I suggest to use desktop or pc for easier to following up this post.
Input your credential or create your wallet

You will see several wallet on your zelcore app by default, you can choose whatever you like.
let's say you choose investment wallet.
add asset `FLUX` if it still not added yet.

If you buy with zelcore app then `you can skip this` but if you buy from centralized exchange like [gate.io][gateio].
go to the FLUX address

</centre>
send your bought FLux in gateio to this address.
it will be very fast more or less 30minutes to 1 hour.

## Staking to TITAN NODE

Now that you already have flux.
To stake to shared node titan node, you can go to the [runflux.io sites][runflux].
Go to [FluxOS][fluxos] Tab on the sites.
GO to shared FluxOS on the official sites

And you just need to follow the guide step on the FluxOS, it is very user friendly.
If you need more guide live, you can check the videos below for more detailed steps.

## Conclusion

It is much more convenient for non-technical people who just want to invest in flux.
this passive income is better than hold it on your bank.

For flexibility, I think using shared node is not flexible since you need to trust other people node to stake your node and lock your flux.
if you prefer flexibility, you may better to check cumulus node or any flux node that required you to setup device.

This Titan Node is very easy and fast to participate.
no need to pay VPS service monthtly (if you use VPS).
or you don't need to buy device to participate (if you use your own device to host node like in Cumulus node).

So yeah, now you can choose variety node now in flux.
Go try Titan Node if you interested.
